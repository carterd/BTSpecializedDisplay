## Operating

### Buttons

The display will have either two or three buttons, these buttons are [LEFT], [SELECT] 
and [RIGHT]. In the case of a two button display the user is required to press both [LEFT] and 
[RIGHT] buttons concurrently in order to 'press' [SELECT].

### Turning on the display

If the display has been wired into the Brose motor the display will turn on as soon as the bike is 
turned on. The display can also be powered by a USB connection if the user wishes not to connect
the display to the bike motor.

**WARNING: It is advised not to connect the displays USB while the bike it turned on.**

Once the display is turned on the user can navigate between the three main functional areas of the
display using [LEFT] and [RIGHT]. The three main functional areas are as follows:

 * LET'S RIDE - Connect to the bike for displaying information while riding the bike.

 * CONFIGURE - Configure the settings of the display and the bike.

 * PAIR BIKE - Ensure the display correctly connects to your specific e-bike.

On selecting the correct functional area the user should press [SELECT] in order to enter the
currently selected functional area.

### Pairing Your Bike

This is probably the first step in configuring the display, in order for the display to connect
to the user's e-bike they'll need to pair the display with the bike. This is done by selecting
the 'PAIR BIKE' functional area.

Once 'PAIR BIKE' is selected the display will start searching for your e-bike therefore it's
important to ensure the e-bike that you wish to connect to is turned on, and is not currently 
connected to any other devices. Therefore, if the bike has already been paired with other 
devices such as phones or bike-computers ensure that these devices are no-longer attempting
to connect to the e-bike.

The display at this point should display 'Scanning ...' and show any Bluetooth divces that
are possible to connect to. The user should use [LEFT] and [RIGHT] buttons to navigate to
the Bluetooth device which is their e-bike, and press [SELECT] once that device is highlighted.
A tick should appear next to the deivce that the display is paired with.

In the case of owning multiple batteries for your e-bike, each battery will be identified as
a different device. Therefore the display is able to paired with multiple devices, and hence
on connecting searches for the first device with which it has been paired with that it can
connect to.

Once the e-bike has been selected then the user should navigate to the 'EXIT' and press
[SELECT].

If you wish to remove a paired device then select the 'PAIR BIKE' functional area.
And all paired bikes will be shown in the list even if those devices are nolonger in range
or turned on. Hence the user is able to navigate to the specific device they wish to
un-pair using [LEFT] and [RIGHT] buttons and on pressing [SELECT] while highlighting 
the device they wish to unpair the tick is removed agaist the device and the user should now
navigate to the 'EXIT' option adn press [SELECT].

### Connecting to the Bike

Once the bike has been successfully paired with the display the display can be connected to
the bike by navigating to the main functional area 'LET'S RIDE'.

On selecting 'LET'S RIDE' a green 'spinner' should appear on the display this represents the
display attempting to search and connect to the e-bike. This should normally take about 5 to
10 seconds for the display to connect to the bike. If it's taking eccessive time then it maybe
the bike is already connected with a different device or the display is no-longer paired with
the bike.

Once the display has successfully connected to the bike, one of the bike status screens should
be displayed. The user can then use [LEFT] and [RIGHT] buttons to navigate to the screen they
wish to ride with.

If the user wishes to return to the main functional areas they should hold [SELECT] for about
a second, and release and the display should disconnect from the e-bike and the display returned
to navigating the three main functional areas.

### Configuring the Display

In order to configure the display the user should navigate to the 'CONFIGURE' functional area.

On selecting 'CONFIGURE' a menu is displayed with options to 'EXIT' the configuration or
configure either the bike or the display. The user sould therefore use [LEFT] and [RIGHT]
buttons to navigate to the 'Display' option and press [SELECT].

The following display options are available:

 * Brightness - How bright the display is.

 * Units - If the display should use metric or imperial units.

 * On Start - If the display should attempt to connect to the bike on being turned on.

 * Connection - If the display should attempt to connect to batteries that are not installed the bike.

 * Assist Presets - Manage a number of preset bike asssit levels.

### Configuring the Bike

In order to configure the bike the user should navigate to the 'CONFIGURE' functional area.

On selecting 'CONFIGURE' a menu is displayed with options to 'EXIT' the configuration or
configure either the bike or the display. The user sould therefore use [LEFT] and [RIGHT]
buttons to navigate to the 'Bike' option and press [SELECT].

The following bike options are available:

 * Beeper - If the bike makes a beep on changing the assist levels between 'Eco', 'Trail' and 'Turbo'

 * Assist Levels - The level of assist provided by each of the assist levels 'Eco', Trail' and 'Turbo'

 * Wheel Circumference - Due to restrictions on the bike firmware this will have no affect on the bikes
                         configuration but will affect the calculation of speed used by the display.

### Resetting the Display

In order to reset the display, removing all the paired devices and reseting configuration to the 
default settings the user should hold down [RIGHT] button during turning the display on.

The user should hold [RIGHT] button while the display shows a dot getting larger and larger. If the
users releases the button before the screen is completely filled by the dot the display will not be
reset. Only by holding the [RIGHT] button until the screen has been completely coloured white will
the display be reset.
